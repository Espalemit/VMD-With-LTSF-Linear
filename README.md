# Does VMD + LTSF-Linear Effective Enough for Time-Series Forecasting?

An experiment using Variational Mode Decomposition using LTSF-Linear and few Neural Networks models. This experiment used 4 different datasets for multivariate forecasting and 13 different datasets for univariate forecasting.

Note: Main execution code for Multivariate forecasting was lost, but we are trying to restore it and keep this repository updated
